# Reinventing Variables #

# Reinventing Variable Assignment #

!SLIDE
.notes Today we're going to reinvent variable assignment. I assume you know what that is.
    @@@ ruby
    x = 1
    x     #=> 1

!SLIDE
.notes Variable assignment lets us refer to a value with a name. Why and how would we want to reinvent it? It's the most boring feature of any programming language... right? No. It isn't. As we'll see, it can be about a lot more than that.
    @@@ ruby
    x = 1
    y = 2

    x + y #=> 3

!SLIDE
.notes Before we reinvent it, though, we're going to reimplement it.
# Re-implementing Variable Assignment #

!SLIDE
.notes The goal of this exercise is to make this code work without ever actually using Ruby's variable assignment to assign x to 1 or y to 2.
    @@@ ruby
    Assignment.run do
      x = 1
      y = 2

      x + y
    end

!SLIDE
.notes We're going to do it in two steps. First, we write a 'bind' function that takes an argument and a block, and passes the argument to the block. Then, we're going to transform our code to use 'bind' instead of assignment. Done, right? Well, no. We've got to transform that code.
    @@@ ruby
    def bind(obj, &fn)
      fn.call(obj)
    end

    bind 1 do |x|
      bind 2 do |y|
        x + y
      end
    end

    #=> 3
