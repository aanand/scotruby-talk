Code Blocks in Disguise

(Sorry.)

!SLIDE
.notes What does this code return?
    @@@ ruby
    x = 1
    y = 2

    x + y

    => ?

!SLIDE
.notes It returns 3.
    @@@ ruby
    x = 1
    y = 2

    x + y

    => 3

!SLIDE
.notes What does this code return? Is it even valid?
    @@@ ruby
    x <- 1
    y <- 2

    x + y

    => ?

!SLIDE
.notes It returns 3.
    @@@ ruby
    x <- 1
    y <- 2

    x + y

    => 3

!SLIDE
.notes Well actually, THIS code returns 3.
    @@@ ruby
    Sequence.run do
      x <- 1
      y <- 2

      x + y
    end

    => 3

!SLIDE
.notes How does it work?
# How? #

!SLIDE
.notes Well, before we get into that, there's a bigger question. Why on earth would we want to reimplement something Ruby gives us out of the box - variable assignment - with a funny syntax? Well, that's a very good question.
# Why? #

!SLIDE
.notes So anyway. How it works is, first, let's pretend we wrote it like this.
    @@@ ruby
    Sequence.instance_eval do
      bind 1 do |x|
        bind 2 do |y|
          x + y
        end
      end
    end

!SLIDE
.notes Second, let's implement that mysterious 'bind' method. As you can see, it just calls the block you give it with the object you give it as an argument.
    @@@ ruby
    module Sequence
      class << self
        def bind(obj, &fn)
          fn.call(obj)
        end
      end
    end

    # Nothing to do with "bind" in JS

!SLIDE
.notes Now the imaginary, not-the-actual-code code does what we want.
    @@@ ruby
    Sequence.instance_eval do
      bind 1 do |x|
        bind 2 do |y|
          x + y
        end
      end
    end

    => 3

!SLIDE
.notes So how do we get the original code to work? We need to turn this into this.
    @@@ ruby
    Sequence.run do
      x <- 1
      y <- 2

      x + y
    end

    Sequence.instance_eval do
      bind 1 do |x|
        bind 2 do |y|
          x + y
        end
      end
    end
