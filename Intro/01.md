# Reinventing Variables #

!SLIDE
.notes ...but more accurately, it's about this.
# Reinventing Variable Assignment #

!SLIDE
.notes Well, alright, what we're *really* going to be doing is this. No, don't leave. It's going to be fun.
# Re-implementing Variable Assignment #

!SLIDE
.notes Today we're going to reinvent variable assignment. I assume you know what that is.
    @@@ ruby
    x = 1
    x     #=> 1

!SLIDE
.notes Variable assignment lets us refer to a value with a name. For the purposes of this talk, we're going to pretend variables don't change. The goal of this exercise is to make this code work without ever actually using Ruby's variable assignment to assign x to 1 or y to 2.
    @@@ ruby
    x = 1
    y = 2

    x + y #=> 3

!SLIDE
.notes We're going to do it in two steps. First, we write a 'bind' function that takes an argument and a block, and passes the argument to the block. Then, we're going to transform our code to use 'bind' instead of assignment. Done, right? Well, no. We've got to transform that code.
    @@@ ruby
    def bind(obj, &fn)
      fn.call(obj)
    end

    bind 1 do |x|
      bind 2 do |y|
        x + y
      end
    end

    #=> 3

!SLIDE
.notes One more thing: we're going to be well-behaved and contain our work in a module. OK, we're ready to start.
    @@@ ruby
    Assignment.run do
      x = 1
      y = 2

      x + y
    end
