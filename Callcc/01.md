.notes We just turned some nested callbacks into flat, sequential code.
    @@@ ruby
    DB.connect('localhost', 'root', 'secret') do |db|
      db.table('people') do |table|
        table.insert(name: "Alice") do |row|
          row.id
        end
      end
    end

    Callback.run do
      db    <- wrap(DB).connect('localhost', 'root', 'secret')
      table <- db.table('people')
      row   <- table.insert(name: 'Alice')

      row.id

.notes These frameworks let you write your code in the normal, direct style, rather than what's known as "continuation-passing style".
## Direct Style ##
    @@@ ruby
    result = get(url)
    puts result

## Continuation-Passing Style ##

    @@@ ruby
    get(url) do |result|
      puts result

.notes They do it using a feature of Ruby 1.9 called Fibers.
# Fibers #

- Jump to another bit of code
- Come back later
- Actually just a restricted form of...

!SLIDE incremental
# callcc #

- “CALL with Current Continuation”
- Like Fibers, but more powerful
- Save the entire call stack and resume it any time, as many times as you like
- Will do your fucking head in

!SLIDE
.notes When you call callcc, you pass it a block that takes the current continuation as a proc. Calling that proc is the same as returning.
    @@@ ruby
    require 'continuation'

    def get_number
      callcc do |cc|
        cc.call(3)
      end
    end

    get_number # => 3

.notes Here's our original Sequence code, one more time.
    @@@ ruby
    Sequence.run do
      x <- 1
      y <- 2

      x + y
    end

!SLIDE
.notes We need to change a couple of things. First, the block takes a single argument, 'o'. Second, we need a new operator. Let's call it the 'bellows'. Can you see what it is, really?
    @@@ ruby
    Sequence.run do |o|
      x =o< 1
      y =o< 2

      x + y
    end

!SLIDE
.notes It's assigning the variables, like in normal Ruby code. But it's assigning them to 'o < 1', 'o < 2' etc.
    @@@ ruby
    Sequence.run do |o|
      x = (o < 1)
      y = (o < 2)

      x + y
    end

!SLIDE
.notes In fact, 'o' is a Proc, and the less-than operator is just an alias of 'call'.
    @@@ ruby
    Sequence.run do |o|
      x = o.call(1)
      y = o.call(2)

      x + y
    end

.notes Next, we need to redefine Transformer#run. We can do away with Ruby2Ruby, block.to_sexp et al. This is all we need.
    @@@ ruby
    require 'continuation'

    module Transformer
      def run(&fn)
        callcc do |the_end|
          stack = [the_end]

          next_continuation = proc do |arg|
            stack.pop.call(arg)
          end

          o = proc do |mval|
            callcc do |rtn|
              res = bind(mval) do |value|
                callcc do |cc|
                  stack.push(cc)
                  rtn.call(value)
                end
              end

              next_continuation.call(res)
            end
          end

          (class << o; self; end).class_eval { alias_method :<, :call }

          next_continuation.call(instance_exec(o, &fn))
        end
      end
    end

.notes Sequence now works as before.
    @@@ ruby
    Sequence.run do |o|
      x =o< 1
      y =o< 2

      x + y
    end

    => 3

.notes As does NilCheck.
    @@@ ruby
    NilCheck.run do |o|
      x =o< 1
      y =o< nil

      x + y
    end

    => nil

!SLIDE
.notes As does Search. You get the idea.
    @@@ ruby
    Search.run do |o|
      x =o< ["first", "second"]
      y =o< ["once", "twice"]

      ["#{x} cousin #{y} removed"]
    end

    ["first cousin once removed",
     "first cousin twice removed",
     "second cousin once removed",
     "second cousin twice removed"]
